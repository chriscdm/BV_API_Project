# BV_API_Project
Create an API to deliver song data in JSON format. My plan is to create a flask app and host it using Heroku or another similar service.

Initial commit containing some preliminary work. I set up a virtual python 3 environment and installed the libraries I will need. Created the sqlite db from the script provided in the BV prompt and began working on the script for the app - in its current preliminary stage the app can only deliver the entire songs table in json format. 

Thurs ~ 6:20 - The api now can answer basic get requests involving artist, genre, and song name
